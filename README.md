As a passionate IT professional with a strong foundation in cybersecurity and networking, I bring both academic excellence and practical experience to the table. I earned my Bachelor's degree in Information Technology from the University of Cincinnati—double majoring in Cybersecurity and Networking—which has provided me with a robust technical background and an in-depth understanding of modern IT challenges.

During my time at the University of Cincinnati, I honed my skills through hands-on roles in the A&S IT department, where I tackled real-world problems and contributed to innovative projects. My GitHub portfolio showcases a variety of projects that reflect my dedication to continuous learning and my proactive approach to solving complex issues.

In addition to my academic and practical experience, I currently have my Cisco Certified Network Associate (CCNA) and my Security+ certifications. I am driven by a commitment to cybersecurity best practices and a desire to contribute to safeguarding digital infrastructures in an ever-evolving technological landscape.

I am excited about connecting with fellow IT professionals and exploring new opportunities where I can leverage my expertise, expand my skill set, and make a meaningful impact in the IT industry.

## Objective

During my time at the University of Cincinnati, I have developed a strong interest in blue team operations and network design/security. I am actively seeking Soc Analyst and other security-focused positions where I can build upon my skills.
