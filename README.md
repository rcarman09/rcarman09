As a recent graduate from the University of Cincinnati, I am excited to pursue a professional career in Information Technology. My academic journey has been driven by a commitment to continuously expand my knowledge and skillset in this field.

## Objective

During my time at the University of Cincinnati, I have developed a strong interest in blue team operations and network design/security. With a strong foundation in these areas, I am actively seeking positions as a SOC Analyst or Network Administrator/NOC to leverage my knowledge and contribute however I can.
